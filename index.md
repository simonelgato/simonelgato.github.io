Wecome to "Reducing Uncertainty."
This is a place where I write various more or less interesting things, mostly but probably not exclusively about medical statistics, clinical trials, and evidence in healthcare. I write these posts mainly for myself, to hellp me work out my thinking  about interesting things. I find it useful to put them iin blog format because (a) I can find them again, (b) writing a coherent piece requires me to think things through  properly, (c) It may be useful to others, and (d) it allows others to comment and help me improve my understanding.

Hopefully it's of interest to some people - you can contact me by email if you want to discuss anything.

The initial set of posts that will appear here are copied across from previous versions of the blog, and have been written over the last few years. More posts will be added when time and energy permit.
